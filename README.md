# Bingus Shared Loader

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Required dependency for Enemy Spawn Multiplier, Armory Preview Cache, Know Your Constellation, Controllable Hover Pack, Vehicle Stability, Enemy Collision Synchronized, Vanilla Plus Megapack or the separate Better Stratagem Bounce, Hellpod Steering Unlocked, Reinforcement Beacons Fixed, Consistent Vaulting, Shallow Water Diving and Sentry Aim Retention mods.** Install with **Arsenal or HD2MM**: import `Bingus-Shared-Loader-v14.zip`, enable it alongside the megapack or your chosen mods, then click **Deploy**. One loader installation supports all your selected mods.
>
> **Arsenal (default priority): place Bingus Shared Loader LAST, at the bottom of the load order**, then **Purge / Deploy**. If you enabled first-mod priority, place the loader first instead.

**v14 / API 1** adds a shared log folder for updated mods and retains all existing module registrations. Current standalone copies may remain installed alongside the pack. shared resource identities and per-mod guards prevent duplicate initialization. The loader remains a separate package.

Starts your installed CowboyBingus mods and supported third-party mods together. The loader has no gameplay effect by itself.

**Install:** Close Helldivers 2. Import `Bingus-Shared-Loader-v14.zip` and your chosen gameplay ZIPs into **HDArsenal** or **HD2MM**, enable them, and deploy. Keep the loader enabled while any dependent mod is enabled.

This is **v14 / API 1**. Replace the previous loader entry, then **Purge / Deploy**. The manager GUID and runtime API marker are unchanged, so existing module-only gameplay packages remain compatible. Do not install old and new loader copies together. See [installation](INSTALL.txt). The preceding loader was confirmed working with Know Your Constellation. This release retains that registration and its API.

## Supported modules

- Enemy Spawn Multiplier, for encounter budget, patrol interval and population-cap scaling.
- Armory Preview Cache, for retained equipment thumbnails, asset preloading and learned startup preparation in Armory and mission briefing.

- Vanilla Plus Megapack, including the CowboyBingus gameplay modules below.
- Better Stratagem Bounce.
- Hellpod Steering Unlocked.
- Reinforcement Beacons Fixed, formerly Reinforcement Beacon Fix.
- Consistent Vaulting, for local manual-vault candidate processing.
- Shallow Water Diving, for local airborne water-reference handling.
- Sentry Aim Retention, for experimental autonomous-sentry target-loss handling.
- Enemy Collision Synchronized, for compatible large enemy corpses across all three factions.
- Know Your Constellation, for local enemy forecasts on mission previews and briefing.
- Controllable Hover Pack, for manual hover cutoff with native landing assistance using the Jump Pack control (default Space).
- Vehicle Stability, for experimental local-driver yaw assistance on the Bastion and gunner FRV.
- HUD Ballistic Trajectory Overlay **v2**, released September 11, 2026.
- The reserved Wide Angle Stratagems module, if separately installed.

Each gameplay package owns its own Lua resource and is optional. A missing or failed module does not prevent later modules from loading. A registered name does not mean a release exists or establish that module's gameplay compatibility.

The loader owns `core/wwise/lua/wwise_flow_callbacks`, preserves the original audio callbacks and leaves `boot` unchanged. HUD+ **0.1.3** can coexist through its existing startup script. the loader does not start HUD+ a second time.

## HUD Ballistic Trajectory Overlay v2

Install the original overlay separately and give **Bingus Shared Loader the winning priority over the overlay** in your manager, then Purge and Deploy. Arsenal still reports their shared startup file as a conflict. this overlap is expected for the supported pair. The loader starts the installed overlay automatically. No extra compatibility mod is required, and other gameplay mods are optional.

The overlay keeps its own configuration and defaults. Its optional `HUDBTO.ini` belongs beside the game's `bin` and `data` folders, as directed by the original package. The loader neither changes nor installs that file.

The maintainer confirmed v3 works in-game with the v2 overlay linked in [technical notes](docs/TECHNICAL.md). Offline checks also cover startup, configuration reads and callback forwarding with HUD+ and the gameplay modules. Future releases need revalidation if their startup changes. Other startup replacements can still conflict. this loader does not merge arbitrary scripts.

Supported: Steam build **24826606** / EXE **1.8.45317.0**. Callback preservation, missing-module behavior and manager deployment are checked independently of each gameplay mod's behavior.

Loader v14 creates `%LOCALAPPDATA%/CowboyBingus/Helldivers2/Logs` for its own log and all updated CowboyBingus mod logs. Each mod retains its existing filename.
